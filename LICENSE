The code base is heavily influenced by Sebastian Graves Dark Souls tutorial series on youtube,as such HIS code is public domain and is free to be used with proper credit given (like this),

however the final product of the game, the modifications to the code, and more-over, the storyline of the game itself is not to be replicated or distributed by any entity other than Arius Black Studios.
